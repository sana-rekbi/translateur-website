I wanted to build a text-speech full stack application with Python that would take english and translate it to kinyarwanda using all supported libraries for natural language processing ( NPL ), but didn't get data for kinyarwanda.

The motivation behind building this was from an article i came across on the internet.

---- to use the application


--- clone the repo using "  git clone repo name "

-- cd into the repo that was cloned

-- run this command to open it on the web " open index.html"
